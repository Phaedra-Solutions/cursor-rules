Ever feel like your cursor has a mind of its ownâ€”dancing around your screen like itâ€™s in a freestyle battle? Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ve been there. Thatâ€™s why our team created Cursor Rulesâ€”so you can code smarter, not rage-quit faster.

If you need help with your cursor (or, you know, actual development), hit us up at **sales@phaedrasolutions.com**. Weâ€™re real humans, we donâ€™t bite, and we might even throw in some dad jokes. Letâ€™s build something awesome together! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’»
